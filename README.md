PROJECT question:  Which socioeconomic variables influence the level of digital skills?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Digital Divide in Barcelona  Survey 2020 --> https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/ca/dataset/enquesta-escletxa-digital
2542 survey respondents

Analysis: 

Know whether AGE, GENDER , INCOME , EDUCATION, DISTRICT , OCCUPATION have an impact on the level of Digital Skills of survey respondents. 
Digital Skills define here as the sum of INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION and PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS.

The indicators for digital skills were taken from the [ESMS Indicator Profile (ESMS-IP)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tepsr_sp410_esmsip2.htm)
We selected the questions from the survey that coincide with the ESMS Indicator Profile (ESMS-IP). Therefore we were not able to compile any information about SOFTWARE SKILLS, and PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS was only partially built. Therefore, it is important to remember this while looking at the projects results. These are partial and only indicate the potential of these type of analysis.
